# Core Source

This directory will hold the core Python code for the Causal-Sentiment-Engine. The goal of this project is to use AI to analyse real-time unstructured data from social media, news and economic indicators, mapping market narratives and detecting sentiment anomalies to infer causal links in stock movements. Contributions should focus on data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training code. Please see the project README for goals and open issues.
