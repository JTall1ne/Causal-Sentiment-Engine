# API Backend

This directory will contain the FastAPI backend implementation for the Causal Sentiment Engine. The API will expose endpoints for narrative maps, sentiment anomaly alerts, and impact simulations.

* `routers/` will include FastAPI routers for various endpoints.
* `services/` will contain business logic for model inference and data aggregation.
* `models/` will define Pydantic models for request and response bodies.

Please contribute by adding the necessary modules and endpoints.
